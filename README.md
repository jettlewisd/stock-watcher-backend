# Stock Market Data API

A RESTful API for accessing and managing stock market data, symbols, and exchanges.

## üìä Overview

This application allows users to view market data (price action, price movement dates) for stocks across various exchanges. The data is organized in a hierarchical structure:

- **Exchanges** contain multiple symbols
- **Symbols** represent individual stocks and contain multiple data entries
- **Data Entries** contain price information for a specific symbol on a specific date

---

## üìã Data Relationships

- Each data entry relates to one symbol (many-to-one)
- Each symbol belongs to one exchange (many-to-one)
- Each symbol can have many data entries
- Each exchange can list many symbols

---

## üîë User Access Levels

### Authenticated Users Can:
- View all market data entries
- View all symbols and exchanges
- Retrieve data entries for specific symbols
- Search data entries by trading date
- List symbols on a specific exchange

### Admin Users Can Also:
- Add new symbols
- Update existing symbols
- Remove symbols
- Remove exchanges

## üß™ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jettlewisd/devlink-backend.git
cd devlink-backend
```

2. **Set up PostgreSQL**

Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your system.  
Then create a database for the project:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE devlink_db;
```

3. **Configure application properties**

Edit the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file to match your local PostgreSQL setup (use the values provided below):

```properties
spring.application.name=DevLink

# Database connection
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/devlink_db
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=postgres1
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver

# Hibernate configuration (optional)
spring.sql.init.mode=always
```

4. **Populate the database**

Use the provided SQL file (`schema.sql`, `data.sql`, or any included instructions) to create the tables and add sample data. If no file is included, you will need to add your own data manually. (Check the resources folder for SQL files).

5. **Run the application**

Using IntelliJ IDEA or from the terminal:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The backend will start at: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
