# Stock Market Data API

A RESTful API for accessing and managing stock market data, symbols, and exchanges.

## üìä Overview

This application allows users to view market data (price action, price movement dates) for stocks across various exchanges. The data is organized in a hierarchical structure:

- **Exchanges** contain multiple symbols
- **Symbols** represent individual stocks and contain multiple data entries
- **Data Entries** contain price information for a specific symbol on a specific date

---

## üìã Data Relationships

- Each data entry relates to one symbol (many-to-one)
- Each symbol belongs to one exchange (many-to-one)
- Each symbol can have many data entries
- Each exchange can list many symbols

---

## üîë User Access Levels

### Authenticated Users Can:
- View all market data entries
- View all symbols and exchanges
- Retrieve data entries for specific symbols
- Search data entries by trading date
- List symbols on a specific exchange

### Admin Users Can Also:
- Add new symbols
- Update existing symbols
- Remove symbols
- Remove exchanges

## üß™ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jettlewisd/stock-watcher-backend.git
cd stock-watcher-backend
```

2. **Set up PostgreSQL**

Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your system.  
Then create a database for the project:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE stock_watcher_db;
```

3. **Configure application properties**

Edit the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file to match your local PostgreSQL setup (use the values provided below):

```properties

# Database connection
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/stock_watcher_db
spring.datasource.name=stock_watcher_db
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=postgres1
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver

# Hibernate configuration (optional)
spring.sql.init.mode=always
```

4. **Populate the database**

Use the provided SQL file (`stock_watcher.sql`) to create the tables and add sample data. If no file is included, you will need to add your own data manually. (Check the resources folder for SQL files).

5. **Run the application**

Using IntelliJ IDEA or from the terminal:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
